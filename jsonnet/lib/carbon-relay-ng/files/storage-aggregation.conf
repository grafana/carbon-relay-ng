# You only need this file if you want to use the grafanaNet route
# (https://github.com/grafana/carbon-relay-ng/blob/main/docs/grafana-net.md)
# and you want to configure how points are aggregated when rendering data.
# In all other cases you can ignore this file.
# This file describes what aggregation (rollup) methods to use for long term storage.
# This is an example file.  To find your actual file, check your existing Graphite installation
# if you have one.
# Note that this file is optional - if you don't supply one to the grafanaNet route, the default
# Grafana Cloud aggregations will be used when rendering data.
# Format is documented at https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-aggregation-conf
# Entries are scanned in order, and first match wins.

#
#  name: Arbitrary unique name for the rule
#  pattern: Regex pattern to match against the metric name
#  xFilesFactor: Ratio of valid data points required for aggregation to the next retention to occur
#  aggregationMethod: function to apply to data points for aggregation
