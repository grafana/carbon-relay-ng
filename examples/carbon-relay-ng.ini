## Global settings ##

# instance id's distinguish stats of multiple relays.
# do not run multiple relays with the same instance id.
# supported variables:
#  ${HOST} : hostname
instance = "${HOST}"

## System ##
# this setting can be used to override the default GOMAXPROCS logic
# it is ignored if the GOMAXPROCS environment variable is set
# max_procs = 2
pid_file = "/var/run/carbon-relay-ng.pid"
# directory for spool files
spool_dir = "/var/spool/carbon-relay-ng"

## Logging ##
# one of trace debug info warn error fatal panic
# see docs/logging.md for level descriptions
# note: if you used to use `notice`, you should now use `info`.

## Admin ##

## Inputs ##
### plaintext Carbon ###

# close inbound plaintext connections if they've been idle for this long ("0s" to disable)

### Pickle Carbon ###

## Validation of inputs ##
# Metric name validation strictness for legacy metrics. Valid values are:
# strict - Block anything that can upset graphite: valid characters are [A-Za-z0-9_-.]; consecutive dots are not allowed
# medium - Valid characters are ASCII; no embedded NULLs
# none   - No validation is performed
validation_level_legacy = "medium"
# Metric validation for carbon2.0 (metrics2.0) metrics.
# Metrics that contain = or _is_ are assumed carbon2.0.
# Valid values are:
# medium - checks for unit and mtype tag, presence of another tag, and constency (use = or _is_, not both)
# none   - No validation is performed
validation_level_m20 = "medium"

# you can also validate that each series has increasing timestamps
validate_order = false

# How long to keep track of invalid metrics seen
# Useful time units are "s", "m", "h"

## Instrumentation ##

[instrumentation]
# in addition to serving internal metrics via expvar, you can send them to graphite/carbon
# IMPORTANT: setting this to "" will disable flushing, and metrics will pile up and lead to OOM
# see https://github.com/grafana/carbon-relay-ng/issues/50
# so for now you MUST send them somewhere. sorry.
# If you really don't want them, send them in the relay and then ignore them with the following blocklist entries:
# (fill in the instance - see top of this file - or just remove the '<instance>' bit to drop all carbon-relay-ng data (even from other relays)
# 'prefix service_is_carbon-relay-ng.<instance>',
# 'prefix carbon-relay-ng.stats.<instance>'
# (Also, the interval here must correspond to your setting in storage-schemas.conf if you use grafana hosted metrics)
graphite_addr = "localhost:2003"
graphite_interval = 10000  # in ms
