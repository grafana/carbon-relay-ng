## Validation of inputs ##
# Metric name validation strictness for legacy metrics. Valid values are:

# none   - No validation is performed

# Metric validation for carbon2.0 (metrics2.0) metrics.
# Metrics that contain = or _is_ are assumed carbon2.0.

# none   - No validation is performed

## Instrumentation ##

[instrumentation]
# in addition to serving internal metrics via expvar, you can send them to graphite/carbon
# IMPORTANT: setting this to "" will disable flushing, and metrics will pile up and lead to OOM
# see https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng/issues/50
# so for now you MUST send them somewhere. sorry.
# (Also, the interval here must correspond to your setting in storage-schemas.conf if you use grafana hosted metrics)
